# Data availability

The data that support the findings of this study are derived from pseudonymised
electronic health records and are subject to strict information governance and
ethical approvals.

Specifically, the analyses use data from:
- The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system at South London and
  Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), and
- Linked primary care consultation data from Lambeth DataNet (LDN).

Due to NHS data governance, patient confidentiality, and the terms of ethical
approval, the raw patient-level data cannot be shared publicly and are not
included in this repository.

Researchers wishing to access the data must obtain appropriate approvals,
including an honorary contract with SLaM and approval through the CRIS
governance process. Information on applying for access to CRIS data is available
via the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.

This repository therefore contains analytic scripts only, which can be used to
understand and reproduce the analytical approach described in the manuscript,
subject to appropriate data access.
